#  Irish Hospital Waiting Lists Analysis (2020‚Äì2025)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes **Irish Outpatient Waiting List data (2020‚Äì2025)** to uncover trends in hospital backlogs, waiting time bands, and patient demographics (adults vs children).  
The goal is to highlight **key problem areas** in healthcare delivery and showcase **data-driven insights** for resource allocation and policy decisions.

##  Visualizations & Insights

### 1. Total Waiting Patients (2021‚Äì2025)
![Total Patients](images/total_patients.png)  
- Sharp rise from ~5.1M (2021) to peak ~7.4M (2022).  
- Stabilized at ~7.0M in 2023‚Äì2024.  
- Big drop in 2025 (~4.7M), but still higher than 2021.  
‚û°Ô∏è Backlog peaked in 2022, recovery visible by 2025.  

---

### 2. Top 10 Hospitals with Highest Waiting Patients
![Top Hospitals](images/top_hospitals.png)  
- **Galway University Hospitals** (~2.7M patients) had the highest backlog.  
- **Children‚Äôs Health Ireland, Waterford, Mater Hospital** all >2M patients.  
   Major teaching hospitals carry the heaviest burden.  

---

### 3. Patients by Waiting Time Bands (All Years)
![Waiting Bands](images/waiting_bands.png)  
- Majority of patients (~16M) wait **0‚Äì6 months**.  
- Nearly **5M patients** face extreme delays **>12 months**.  
   Long-term delays still a **systemic issue**.  

---

### 4. Adults vs Children Waiting Lists Over Time
![Adults vs Children](images/adults_vs_children.png)  
- Adults consistently make up the majority (peaking ~6.4M in 2022).  
- Children peaked ~1.05M in 2022, mirroring adult trends.  
‚û°Ô∏è Adults dominate waiting lists, but children follow the same crisis pattern.

### 5. Heatmap: Total Patients by Hospital and Year
![Heatmap](images/hospital_heatmap.png)
- **Galway, Connolly, Cork, Waterford, Mater** stand out with highest loads.  
- Smaller hospitals show lighter shades (lower patient counts).  
   Pressure is **concentrated in a few hospitals**.  

---

### 6. Waiting Time Bands Over Years (Stacked Bar)
![Stacked Bands](images/waiting_bands_yearly.png)  
- **0‚Äì6 months** dominates across all years, peaking 2024.  
- **18 months+** backlog very high in 2021‚Äì22, improved by 2025.  
   Short-term waits are common, but **extreme delays have reduced** by 2025.  

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- Hospital waiting lists **worsened sharply from 2021 to 2022**, remained critical in 2023‚Äì24, but showed **improvement in 2025**.  
- **Galway and major teaching hospitals** (Waterford, Mater, Cork, Children‚Äôs Health Ireland) are consistently overloaded.  
- Most patients are seen within 6 months, but **millions still face delays beyond a year**.  
- Both **adults and children** experienced the same backlog trends.  

---

## üîÆ Future Work
- Add **forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet)** for predicting 2026+ patient counts.  
- Build an **interactive Power BI / Streamlit dashboard** for real-time insights.  
- Extend analysis to **Inpatient & Day Case waiting lists** for a full picture.
